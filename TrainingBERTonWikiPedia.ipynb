He was an apprentice at Poole, Dorset, by 1766, and afterwards began work as an oil-leather dresser. He seems to have been in London by 1782, where he worked as a tallow chandler and oil merchant. By 1785 he was at Walworth and then at Newington. He is also named as a spermaceti refiner there by 1791. Reformer and philanthropist Sturge was a devout Quaker and an elder of the society in London.
